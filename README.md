# SkateHub
* Our app "SkateHub," is an app that will connect skaters all over the world in the future. For this capstone project we will be focusing more on a smaller audience for the time being.
* The app itself will let skaters create a profile in which they can enter basic information about themselves, add friends, find skate spots in their area, and socialize, as well as interact with other local skaters in their area. Skateboarders don't have a set spot they skate, part of the skateboarding world is to venture out and find hidden spots.
* This app will allow users to post these spots with a coordinate location for others to travel to. Users will be able to see what spots their friends are skating and invite their friends to come skate that spot. We wish to bring this to both IOS and Android devices by using the open-source Ionic Framework.

```
git clone https://github.com/SCCapstone/SkateHub.git
```
* Change directory into SkateHub
```
cd SkateHub
```
* Change directory into server
```
cd server
```
* Install the necessary dependencies:

* To connect to mongodb run:
```

* A message in your console should pop up saying Hello WOrld and that you're connected.
